# Guess My Number

Simple game where the objective is to guess a randomly generated number between 1-20 within 20 guesses.

  - Type a number into the text field
  - If the number is incorrect the number of guess left will be decreased and the player will be told if their guess was too high or too low
  - If the number is correct the player wins, number of guesses left is added as a highscore, and the player can play again to try and beat their score
  - The game can be restarted at any time
